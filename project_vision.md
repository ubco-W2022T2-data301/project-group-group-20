# Project Vision

Our vision for the project is to understand consumer behavior and loyalty regarding credit card companies and banks. We also aim to spread awareness revolving around the issue of credit card churning to consumers, especially students so they are educated about the risks involved prior to making crucial banking decisions.
Additionally, we hope to understand the process of data analysis using simple data cleaning and visualization while effectively using Github.
