## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We are focusing on datasets related to finance and economics for this project because it matches our interests. Our group is interested in analyzing churning credit card customers and their reasons for leaving the credit card services. There are a multitude of benefits arising from using credit cards such as online purchases, a free form of credit, bonuses and rewards, and letting you instantly borrow money for purchases. However, many customers opt out of credit services after they utilize their welcome bonuses, cash backs, and travel incentives that only last for a limited period of time and they purchase a new credit card to make use of the new set of bonuses, before their annual fees are charged. As of now, credit card churning is considered legal, although banks and credit card issuers are not satisfied with the idea. In addition, churning credit cards does reduce credit scores and make the customer look like a lender-risk from the bank’s point of view.

The dataset we have chosen revolves around customer attrition, predicting a section of population that is more credible to the practice of credit card churning. The data consists of 21 columns and 10128 rows. The sample used in this dataset comprises 10,000 customers, spanning from personal details such as education and marital status to more specific topic-related factors such as their annual income and credit limit. It originated from a business trying to predict the reason it is losing consumers from their credit card services, and try to y providing better and more-personalized services. The main focus of these companies is to retain consumers and prevent the churning of their credit cards.

The owner of this dataset is Sakshi Goyal, a software engineer at Wipro. She uploaded this dataset around 3 years ago. The dataset was collected from the server logs of the bank.
Through this dataset, we aim to learn about credit card churning and its negative impact on credit score, following debt.

In addition, churning credit cards does reduce credit scores and make the customer look like a lender-risk from the bank’s point of view. We hope to explore the reasons behind cardholders making such decisions knowing its repercussions. An Operational Dashboard will help visualize the data easily to analyze the dynamic changes compatible to the changes in demographics, economy etc.
